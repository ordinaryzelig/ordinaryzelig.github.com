{"name":"Redningja.com","body":"I'm very friendly, easy to talk to, and easy work with. Whether you are technical or not, I talk in plain English with no jargon so that you know exactly what's going on and how things work. I don't just work FOR you, but WITH you. I have been programming in Ruby since 2005. My code is clean, readable, and TESTED.\r\n**I WILL WORK FOR AT A LOWER RATE FOR GOOD CAUSES.**\r\n\r\nI will tackle any Ruby tasks that you need. I can write anything from small Ruby scripts to full-blown Web applications. My HTML/CSS is clean and functional with AJAX where appropriate. I have used many database systems from MySQL to MongoDB.\r\n\r\n## Quality\r\n\r\nMy code is clean, readable, and regularly refactored. **TESTING IS A HIGH PRIORITY IN MY WORK, NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT.**\r\n\r\n## Why testing matters\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as bug-free code. If you were an online bank, how confident are you that every transaction is working like it is designed to? Can you afford to have a bug? With automated tests, you have code that verifies your application is working as expected. Most good programmers nowadays are thoroughly testing their code. It helps with development, and it helps when things go wrong, like things eventually do. Good test coverage can help fix bugs when they pop up. Tests will also help you make sure that fixing a bug here won't cause another bug way over there. If you don't have tests, your bugs will be much more difficult to squash, costing you more time and more money.\r\n\r\n## Efficient and Easy for You\r\n\r\nFor web applications, I use [Heroku](http://heroku.com), a service that allows me to quickly give you a product in a working state so you can immediately interact with it. No work needed on your end. I just give you a web address, and you see results in seconds.\r\n\r\n## Knowledgeable\r\n\r\nI regularly follow Ruby news and attend conferences, so you can be confident that I am keeping up with technology.\r\n\r\n## Flexibility\r\n\r\nI can work any day of the week at any reasonable hour of the day. I've had clients across the globe and have had no problems making myself available at a time that is convenient for them. I respond to emails quickly and give plenty of warning if I will not be available.\r\n\r\n## Does my rate sound too expensive?\r\n\r\nWhile you can find developers around the world that will work for less, it is important to consider quality and what it is worth to you. If you go the cheap route, you could get cheap code that might seem to work but is a constant headache. Your development velocity could feel like swimming through thick sludge. If it's bad enough, you might even need to start over. And what happens when things go wrong? Do your cheap devs have tests to verify their code? \"Cheap and fast\" could take several times longer, costing several times more, not to mention the headaches. So don't just compare rates by their numbers. What is it worth to you to do it the right way?\r\n\r\n## Code\r\n\r\n* [github](https://github.com/ordinaryzelig)\r\n* [gems](http://rubygems.org/profiles/48121)","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
