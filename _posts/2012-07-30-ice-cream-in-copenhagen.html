title: Ice cream in Copenhagen

<p>Pop quiz, hot shot: If you ask for ice cream in Denmark, what do they give you?&nbsp;H&auml;agen-Dazs? Nope. Today I learned that&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H&amp;auml;agen_Dazs#Name">H&auml;agen-Dazs is an American company</a> and has absolutely nothing to do with Scandanavia, except that the creator wanted it to sound Scandanavian. But that doesn't mean they don't have good ice cream there. In fact, I've been told that they have world-class ice cream there. But it's not H&auml;agen-Dazs.</p>
<p>Oh, marketing.&nbsp;Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. H&auml;agen-Dazs is to Denmark as fortune cookies are to China.&nbsp;So I suppose I won't be having&nbsp;H&auml;agen-Dazs in Hamlet's castle. Or will I? Today I also learned that "Elsinore",&nbsp;the castle in Shakespeare's Hamlet is a real place called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronborg">Kronborg</a>. And this is where I was told I should get ice cream.</p>
<p>So much learning, and I haven't even left yet.</p>
<p>$188, 4 nights, $47/night (just over my budget).</p>
