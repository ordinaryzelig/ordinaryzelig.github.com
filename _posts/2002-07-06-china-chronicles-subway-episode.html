<p>today, i met Zhang Li, the director who i will be following. &nbsp;this could be the start of a life-altering career move&hellip;</p>
<p>but let&rsquo;s not talk about that right now. &nbsp;i&rsquo;d like to talk about the subway for a moment.</p>
<p><!--more-->i had my first subway experience the other day. &nbsp;first i think i should tell you, although you probably already know, that chinese people don&rsquo;t use deodorant. &nbsp;some of you know that i, a chinaman by blood, do no sweat easily. &nbsp;maybe it&rsquo;s a genetic thing. &nbsp;i thought about it&hellip;no, because my dad can sweat a good one. &nbsp;well, let me tell you, the people here sweat buckets a day. &nbsp;chinese people use onion paper rather than the thick stuff we use. &nbsp;wanna know why? &nbsp;because they need the other half to wipe off the sweat from their faces.</p>
<p>so my host mom wants to take me to this high-class shopping strip not quite unlike champs elysees in paris. &nbsp;gotta take the subway to get there. &nbsp;we walk down about a mile underground. &nbsp;at the bottom, it&rsquo;s very quiet. &nbsp;the only sounds are from newspapers swishing around or the occasional high-heel. &nbsp;finally a breeze blows some skirts up a little and the remaining hairs of a majorly receding hair-line too. &nbsp;the train runs through with lots and lots of people of which only a few get off. &nbsp;my host mom and i squeeze our bodies in. &nbsp;so i&rsquo;m in a train full of smelly people who don&rsquo;t use deodorant with no fans or a/c where everybody has their arms up holding on to the rails&hellip;mmmm. &nbsp;chinese guys like to do this thing with their t-shirts (if they&rsquo;re wearing one, god willing). &nbsp;they wad their t-shirts from the bottom as far up as they can go and hold it there with their arms relaxed exposing their bellies. &nbsp;that&rsquo;s right, stuff cloth up your armpits so it sweats even more. &nbsp;and being the short person i am, my nose just happens to be at armpit level. &nbsp;but, jared, you&rsquo;re in china, aren&rsquo;t you considered tall there? &nbsp;i&rsquo;ve observed that there is no difference. &nbsp;it&rsquo;s just that old chinese people shrivel and shrink more than americans. &nbsp;if you don&rsquo;t believe me, go find a 70+ chinese person over 5 foot. &nbsp;they just don&rsquo;t exist. &nbsp;so when i&rsquo;m over 70, i&rsquo;m going to be a smurf. &nbsp;it&rsquo;s ok when smurfs sweat. &nbsp;that&rsquo;s where they get that &ldquo;blue stuff&rdquo; you see at the mall.</p>
