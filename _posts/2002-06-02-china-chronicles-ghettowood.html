<p>after getting used to beijing a little bit, i finally got to see a little bit of what i came to see. &nbsp;my connection Tong was going to take around and see what she does for a living. &nbsp;my host mom drove me there in the morning. &nbsp;on the way there, we passed by this neighborhood. &nbsp;she called it something in chinese and i didn&rsquo;t understand what it was. &nbsp;she explained that people around her carry guns. &nbsp;ahhh, the ghetto. &nbsp;glad i&rsquo;m not living here. &nbsp;15 seconds later, &ldquo;here we are.&rdquo; &nbsp;great, i&rsquo;m going to be working in the middle of the ghetto. &nbsp;i&rsquo;m going to get mugged every day.</p>

<p>Tong works for the chinese army. &nbsp;they&rsquo;re not allowed to take american interns. &nbsp;i wondered if anybody would suspect something if i came here everyday. &nbsp;apparently i&rsquo;ll be working somewhere else. &nbsp;Tong took me to one of her offices and showed me what she does. &nbsp;she&rsquo;s a sound person. &nbsp;she puts voices in the right place and puts sound effects in movies and tv shows. &nbsp;she took me to the editing room where this lady was editing a movie on the computer. &nbsp;looked interesting. &nbsp;i figure that&rsquo;s part of what i&rsquo;ll be doing.</p>
<p>the most exciting part was when she took me to an actual sound stage. &nbsp;an actual set where they were in the middle of filming a chinese opera for television. &nbsp;it was cool. &nbsp;i got to see a real shoot. &nbsp;the best part was that i really felt in place. &nbsp;i can&rsquo;t wait to make movies.</p>
