<p>I had been looking forward to Switzerland for a while. At last, I can see some natural beauty. First stop, Zurich.</p>
<p><!--more-->Actually, Zurich wasn't my favorite place. Walking through Old Town was almost nothing but shopping. And I went to an art museum that was disappointing.</p>
<p>There was one saving grace, so to speak. There's an abbey called Fraum&uuml;nster. They have some stained glass windows by Marc Chagall, and they are incredible. It's a series of 5 windows each telling a biblical story. I think they would've caught my eye even in an art gallery, but seeing them as stained glass windows is really amazing. They don't allow pictures inside, so all I can do is show you some from the internet.</p>
