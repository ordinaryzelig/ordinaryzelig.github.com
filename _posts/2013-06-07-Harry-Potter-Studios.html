<p>The first time I tried reading Harry Potter, I couldn't get into it. When the 1st movie was about to come out, I was in film school in college. I thought I should read the book before judging the movies because I wanted to experience the movie the same way most of the audience would too. So started reading them. Just a shade under a decade later, I finally finished them all (the books). I liked the movies a lot too, of course. I've visited the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Orlando, and it was great. But this was something else. This was the real deal.</p>

<p>These are a few wizard's chess pieces in front of the entrance.</p>

<p>Wands. My favorite part. How people design wands to match fictional characters' personalities is really interestingto me.</p>

<p>Door to Chamber of Secrets. One of many things that were surprisingly not CG. Moody's eye was also not CG.</p>

<p>Phoenix staircase to Dumbledore's office. It actually works. It required a moving poll that extends into the ground several yards.</p>

<p>Dumbledore's memory cabinet. It contains hundreds of vials filled with memories. Each is hand made and hand labeled.</p>

<p>#4 Privet Drive, home of Harry Potter. The house is real and has an interior. The neighbors' houses are just facades.</p>
