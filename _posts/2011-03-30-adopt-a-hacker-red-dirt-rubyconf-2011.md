Going to [Red Dirt RubyConf 2011](http://reddirtrubyconf.com)?
Need a cheap place to stay?
How about a FREE place to stay?
Inspired by [Adopt A Hacker](http://www.adoptahacker.com), I'm offering just that.
I live in NW Oklahoma City, which is about a 40 minute drive to Norman.
I know that's a bit far, but hey, it beats paying [$149/night](embassysuites.hilton.com/en/es/groups/personalized/O/OKCESES-RDR-20110420/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG).

There is 1 catch.
I'm not planning to attend the 2nd day of the conference (Friday, 22nd).
So you'll have to drive yourself or [find a ride](http://twitter.com/?status=@RedDirtRubyConf%20=%20gem%20'me',%20'4.22.2011',%20require:%20'ride_to_red_dirt_rubyconf',%20source:%20'NW%20OKC,%20May%20and%20122nd'%20%23executabletweet).
But I am attending on Thursday (including Hackfest, if you want).
I also want to go to Heroes Dinner on Wednesday if you're interested.

I have a futon and an air mattress, so I can probably take 2 people.

If you have any questions, [email me](mailto:jared@redningja.com), or Direct Message me at [@redningja](http://twitter.com/redningja).
