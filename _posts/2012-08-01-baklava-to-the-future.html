<p><em>(Alright, I admit, that was horrible. It's the best I could come up with.)</em></p>
<p>I'm going on a 2-week cruise of the Mediterranean. It includes a stop in Greece for 1 day. However, I don't think that's nearly enough time to experience Greece. Since the cruise isn't the end of my trip, I'll be going right back as soon as we disembark. I just bought a plane ticket from Rome to Athens so I can experience Greece for a few more days (I'm thinking like 4 or 5).</p>
<p>My dad will be leaving to go home after the cruise. His flight leaves 15 minutes after mine from the same airport. So it looks like I will be mooching for a free ride to the airport. Let's just hope our cruise ship arrives on time (at frickin 4am apparently), and preferrably right side up. During my "dinner with the captain" I will be thoroughly checking under his nose.</p>
<p>Normally, I go for an aisle seat, but it seems like a good idea to have a good view of what I'm flying over for this trip. It's only a 2 hour flight anyway. So this time I went for a window seat -- an "isle seat"???</p>
<p>$74. I estimated $200 originally, so this should help keep my budget down. Sweet.</p>
