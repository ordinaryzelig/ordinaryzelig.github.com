<p>hey everybody. &nbsp;long time no see. &nbsp;guess what? &nbsp;i&rsquo;m more than halfway through my trip! &nbsp;34 more days to go!</p>
<p>no good stories for you lately, sorry. &nbsp;the best i can do is my little &ldquo;subway with a gay man&rdquo; novella. &nbsp;it&rsquo;s not exactly a full fledged episode. &nbsp;anyway, so i met this guy today at the place i&rsquo;m working with my director. &nbsp;at the start he was very quiet, and i thought he looked a little mean, until i heard him talk&hellip;and walk. &nbsp;overt body movements, limp hand, and all. &nbsp;i thought to myself. &nbsp;this man is gay. &nbsp;well, turns out we ride the same way on the subway to get home (don&rsquo;t take that metaphorically. &nbsp;i&rsquo;m not gay, i have a very pretty girlfriend). &nbsp;we walk to the station and he jumps over a very low chain. &nbsp;he cleared the chain easily, but it looked like he tripped in midair. &nbsp;yup, this guy has to be gay.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>so we get on the subway and see this lady right next to and facing the door holding her toddler in her arms. &nbsp;all of a sudden a trickle comes down from the kid. &nbsp;for future reference, there is no five second rule in china. &nbsp;you drop it, it&rsquo;s gone. &nbsp;they end up sitting next to us. &nbsp;baby lookin right at my gay friend (don&rsquo;t even know his name). &nbsp;he asks me if i like kids and i told him that oriental kids are particularly cute. &nbsp;he says that american kids are cute too. &nbsp;yes yes, lots of fun. &nbsp;he&rsquo;s gay.</p>
<p>i really do think oriental babies are very cute. &nbsp;but something happens when they become teenagers. &nbsp;they just aren&rsquo;t so cute anymore. &nbsp;Kristin Thomason once asked me, &ldquo;you used to be cute, what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>on our way to switch lines, he asks me if i think chinese girls are pretty. i don&rsquo;t know why, but i&rsquo;ve been asked this question many times. &nbsp;almost as many times as where my girlfriend is from and why she didn&rsquo;t come with me. anyway, i told him that i didn&rsquo;t think they were that pretty and that American girls are prettier. &nbsp;and before i met Lina, i was never really attracted to oriental girls. &nbsp;he said that it&rsquo;s just because i haven&rsquo;t seen any really pretty chinese girls yet. &nbsp;i think he was just trying to cover up his gayness. &nbsp;i really want to ask him, but, for one, i don&rsquo;t know how to say gay in chinese, besides, &ldquo;do you like guys.&rdquo; &nbsp;second of all, i don&rsquo;t know how the gay scene is in china. &nbsp;like is it taboo, or against communism, or confucious would never have approved. &nbsp;i have no idea.</p>
<p>the end. &nbsp;happy july 4th everybody! &nbsp;you have to celebrate for me ok? &nbsp;i&rsquo;m afraid if i do, i might get arrested. &nbsp;hostbro said he would take me to the us embassy where they celebrate it, but i&rsquo;m afraid it will be like a pathetic commercial. &nbsp;and how much of a dork would i be if i went to the us embassy to celebrate july 4th? &nbsp;so i&rsquo;m going to take Kristin&rsquo;s advice and light a match and squint and pretend it&rsquo;s fireworks. &nbsp;be safe and have fun! &nbsp;miss you guys!</p>
