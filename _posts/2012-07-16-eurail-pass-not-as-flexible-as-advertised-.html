title: Eurail pass not as flexible as advertised?

<p>Just called Eurail about how to make reservations ahead of time before I activate my pass. I am very discouraged now. She said I have to make reservations way in advance because reservations in Europe are very hard to get. Apparently I have to get a physical ticket mailed to me for a reservation. All that adds up to me having to plan the bulk of my trip before I even leave. If this is true, this kind of defeats the "freedom" the pass was supposed to get me. Not pleased.</p>
