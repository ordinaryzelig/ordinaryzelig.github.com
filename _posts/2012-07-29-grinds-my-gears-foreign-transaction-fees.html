title: 'Grinds my Gears: Foreign Transaction Fees'
published: true
---
<p>Today, I saw my credit card statement and noticed a foreign transaction fee of almost $60. Bugger! I didn't think I had made any foreign transactions yet. Turns out, it was for the Eurail pass, which cost almost $2,000. It's sneaky considering I paid in US dollars, but still a mistake on my part. I plan on pulling a "Cancel my credit card because I don't like foreign transaction fees" maneuver to see if they will waive the fee to keep me as a customer. It's a card I'm not attached to if I end up having to cancel it. I've already received my 50K miles bonus. But still. Rookie mistake.&nbsp;From now on, I'll try to be more careful and use my Capital One card that doesn't have FTFs. BUGGER!</p>
