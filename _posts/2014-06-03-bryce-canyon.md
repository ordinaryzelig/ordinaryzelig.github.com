We flew from Boston to St. George, Utah, picked up a rental car, and drove to Bryce, Utah.
This was the beginning of part 2 of our trip, the national parks.
Bryce Canyon is the most unique national park I've been to.
It's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology)" target="_blank">hoodoos</a> that distinguish it.
We took a bus tour of the area and spent a few hours on an awesome hike to the bottom and back up.

One evening, we attended an astronomy talk.
Afterwards, we were invited to join some astronomers who shared their fancy telescopes with for us to use.
Because of its elevation, seclusion, and low "light pollution", Bryce is one of the best places to do this.
We saw the moon in detail like never before and even a small blue dot that was Saturn.
