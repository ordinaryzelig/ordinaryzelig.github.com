title: Quick stop in Cologne
categories: travel

<p>I'm taking an overnight train from Copenhagen on my way to <a href="{% post_url 2012-07-30-bruges-hometown-of-dr-evil %}">Bruges</a>&nbsp;(or at least that's the plan). Bruges isn't a big enough town where I can get a direct train ride from Copenhagen. One of my choices for stops was Cologne. From there, I can get to Bruges in a couple hours. But after talking to someone about <a href="{% post_url 2012-07-30-ice-cream-in-copenhagen %}">Copenhagen</a>, she immediately said that if I do anything in Cologne, I should go see the cathedral that is right outside the train station. Judging from the <a href="http://bit.ly/MOTTv1">pictures</a>, she was right. I didn't want to be rushed, so I decided to stay a night in Cologne.</p>
