<p>Day 4</a> we went to Epcot. It feels a lot like a kids version of the World Expo. We went to all the different countries. Cecelia tried escargot (didn't like it). It feels a little dated, but it's still pretty fun.<!--more--></p>

<p>It rained when we first got there, but only sprinkled. The rest of the day was really nice and cool.</p>

<p>Cecelia took this picture.</p>

<p>Cecelia got to meet several characters, mostly princesses, at their respective countires of origin.</p>

<p>We also went to the Finding Nemo building where there's a little ride. The entire building is like an aquarium. There's a very clever "show" called Turtle Talk with Crush (the big sea turtle in the movie). The kids sit in front of a movie screen that just shows an empty sea floor. Then Crush comes on screen and interacts with the kids! This is an animated sea turtle and he's actually talking to the kids and moving around as if he's actually there. Even Cecelia got to talk to him. Magical.</p>
