<p>Berne is a charming city in Switzerland. There's not much to do except walk around town, eat, and go to a couple art museums, which was fine by me since the weather was cold and wet.. Most of the walking areas of Berne are covered so it worked out alright.</p>

<p>The first day I spent just walking through town looking at all the shops. It's very different than Zurich though &ndash; more boutiques than Bulgari. I found a rare item as well. It was an out-of-print addition to a German-created board game I learned in Africa. I look forward to translating the German into hours of rare, out-of-print, board game fun.</p>

<p>The other thing I did that day was to visit the origin of the name for the city of Berne: the bears. It's the biggest enclosure I've ever seen for bears. The 3 large bears have a wonderful view of the river that bear hugs the city that hugs them back.</p>

<p>I also went to the Paul Klee Museum. It's housed in a very unique building that looks like the top layer of pasta on lasagna. I am now a fan of Paul Klee's work. I also really like that much of his art is very good for kids. The museum even has a few rooms dedicated to kids where thy can just show up and participate in making art. I plan to use Paul Klee to somehow get my 6-year-old niece interested in art.</p>
<p>There were 2 culinary highlights in this city. The first was a wonderful, underground restaurant called Kornhauskeller. The ground level entrance doesn't look like much &ndash; like the lobby to a motel. At the center is the stairwell down into the restaurant. The horizon of the ceiling revealed the main dining area and I was amazed. Underground, the huge, tall room was like a classic train station converted into a restaurant. The food was excellent. Cockerel (technically rooster, basically chicken) with bacon, and a side of rich lemon risoto.</p>

<p>The second highlight was the surprise in my host's fridge. She left a shelf empty for my groceries. After learning about my lack of Dr. Pepper on my Europe trip, the next day I found a can of Dr. Pepper on my shelf.</p>
