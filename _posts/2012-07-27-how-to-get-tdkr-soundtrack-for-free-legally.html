title: How to get TDKR soundtrack for free legally
categories: blog
---
<p><strong>Update:</strong>&nbsp;Amazon says "Limit of one promotional credit per order". I wiould interpret that as you can only apply $2 max for a single purchase. Bummer.</p>
<p>Fandango.com&nbsp;has a <a href="http://www.fandango.com/promo/amazonmp3">promotion</a> going on right now. If you buy any movie tickets in the month of July, you get $2 of Amazon MP3 credit. Go watch The Dark Knight Rises 4 times (you are watching it multiple times, aren't you?). If you buy your tickets through fandango, you'll get $8 in credit -- enough to buy the <a href="http://amzn.to/P7aW5A">TDKR soundtrack</a>. Make sure you get the deluxe edition which comes with a few extra tracks for the same price.&nbsp;I've done this 3 times, and I've received the $2 credit each time.</p>
<p>The fine print says you will get credit for each ticket purchase transaction. I tried buying 2 tickets to the same screening separately, but still only received $2 credit.</p>
