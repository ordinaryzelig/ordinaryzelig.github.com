  Christopher Columbus thought that if he sailed so far west, further than anybody had ever sailed, he would circle the earth and find India.
  He got lost, but discovered something much better than he had ever hoped for.

  This blog is about my travels.
  Traveling is about discovering boundaries and breaking them down. Mark Twain wrote,
  "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness....
  Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime."

  I like going to distant lands, places I don't know much about. Getting lost is a great way to make discoveries.
