<p>I'm back in Spain for a couple days. It seems like the top things to do are 3 art museums.&nbsp;I spent the majority of my 2 days walking through these art museums. I spent more than 6 hours at the Thyssen, more than 4 hours at the Prado, and 3 hours at the Sofia.&nbsp;After visiting all 3, I think they make Madrid a contender for a world-class destination for art. It is afterall, the home country of Picasso who is easily one of my favorite artists.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, my visit was not without some form of political friction. Many places around Europe organized a coordinated protest. I heard them count down the beginning of a march at midnight from where I was staying. The next day, on my way to one of the museums, I suddenly found myself walking shoulder to shoulder with protesters. At one point I walked in front of a camera. I hope the world now knows that Oklahoma tourists in Madrid won't stand for the greed of the 1%.</p>
<p>Spain is not in a good place right now. 1 out of 4 people are unemployed. Many of my hosts on my trip including both in Spain have had trouble finding work They even make economic crisis voodoo dolls.</p>
