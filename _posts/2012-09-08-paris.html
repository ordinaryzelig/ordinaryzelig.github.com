<p>I'm not sure what it was, but I just wasn't feeling all that excited about Paris. I think part of it has to do with it being the only place on my trip that I've been before. And only being here 3 days (practically just 1.5), I kind of only treated it as a hub stop on my way to Barcelona.</p>

<p>I did the usual: Mus&eacute;e du louvre, Notre Dame, and the Eiffel tower. Notre Dame was the only place I hadn't been.</p>
<p>The Louvre was nice as usual. But it's just such a beast of a museum, it's a big bite to chew. I really don't remember having to wait in a line that was 3 times longer than the line for the The Dark Knight Rises. I was really lucky, however, that I came on the first Sunday when admission is free. The line was only that long to get everyone through security: about 45 minutes for me. If it weren't that day, it would've taken 2 hours according to the sign.</p>
<p>Notre Dame is nice, but not nearly as nice as the Dom in Cologne. The stain glass windows were really nice though. I guess one good thing about being occupied is that you're less likely to get bombed and your stuff is more likely to survive.</p>
