<p>swimming in a pool with a bunch of chinese. &nbsp;never thought of such a concept. &nbsp; i was almost grossed out by the thought of it. &nbsp;afterall, they don&rsquo;t call it the yellow river for nothing. &nbsp;just kidding. &nbsp;so me and Zhang, my step-mom&rsquo;s sister-in-law took me to an indoor swimming pool. &nbsp;she showed them her card and they punched a hole and gave her a key. &nbsp;she showed me the signs, &ldquo;this is the exit, this is the entrance.&rdquo; &nbsp;i was about to walk in until she took me to the other side where we repeated steps 1-3. &nbsp;lucky for me we did because i was informed that this side was for boys and the other was for girls. &nbsp;so Zhang gives me a towel, a swimming cap, some goggles, some soap and some flip-flops and sends me off all by myself.</p>

<p>i go in and see a whole bunch of little kids running around. &nbsp;so i&rsquo;m trying to find my locker in this crammed room with screaming little boys &mdash; uh, now there are screaming little naked boys. &nbsp;i still don&rsquo;t understand that whole slapping of the butt thing. &nbsp;especially screaming little naked boys&rsquo; butts. &nbsp;i still can&rsquo;t find my locker so i walk around some more. &nbsp;shower room. &nbsp;didn&rsquo;t need to see that. &nbsp;finally find my locker and change.</p>
<p>walk out to the olympic sized pool. &nbsp;i start walking around wondering if i would be swimming by myself too. &nbsp;guy stops me and asks me if i&rsquo;m going to swim and i say yes. &nbsp;&rdquo;then where&rsquo;s your swimming cap,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;&rdquo;i don&rsquo;t use one,&rdquo; i say. &nbsp;he retorts, &ldquo;you have to, it&rsquo;s a rule.&rdquo; &nbsp;great, jared in a swimming cap. &nbsp;too bad i didn&rsquo;t see myself in the mirror. &nbsp;sorry, no pictures. &nbsp;i find Zhang and we jump in and start swimming. &nbsp;kinda cold. &nbsp;swim swim swim. &nbsp;in march about a thousand little kids. &nbsp;i was later told that in the fifth grade, everybody has to take swim lessons. &nbsp;there are adults and littler kids too. &nbsp;one chubby little girl in a tube decided to come over and say something that i didn&rsquo;t understand and splash some water in my face. &nbsp;&rdquo;alright,&rdquo; i said.</p>
<p>we decide to take a break and sit down a bit. &nbsp;we talked for a while. &nbsp;she asked me if what i was wearing was made for swimming. &nbsp;i looked at her kinda funny and said yes. &nbsp;she said she had never seen swimming suits like mine before. &nbsp;&rdquo;really?&rdquo; i said. &nbsp;i look around and notice that all the males, old and young, skinny and not so skinny alike, are all wearing speedos. &nbsp;man, i was glad i brought my own.</p>
