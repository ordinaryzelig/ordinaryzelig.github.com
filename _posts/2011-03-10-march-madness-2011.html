<p>Hi everyone. It's time for March Madness again!</p>
<p>Selection Sunday is this Sunday, March 13, and the tournament starts the following Thursday, March 17.</p>
<p>There is a NEW SCORING SYSTEM this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st round: 1 point + seed</li>
<li>2nd round: 2 points&nbsp;+ seed</li>
<li>3rd round: 4 points&nbsp;+ seed</li>
<li>4th round: 8 points&nbsp;+ seed</li>
<li>5th round: 16 points&nbsp;+ seed</li>
<li>6th round: 32 points&nbsp;+ seed</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(The lame "first four" is not counted)</em></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>So if you correctly pick a 1 seed to win in the 1st round, you get 2 points. If an 11 seed wins in the 4th round, you get 19 points. This should keep more people in the running to win deeper into the tournament.</p>
<p>Entry fee is the same: $10/person. 1 bracket per person. Anybody can play. Prize structure will be announced when the tournament starts.</p>
<p>I'll be using CBS again. Click <a href="http://merrymadness.mayhem.cbssports.com/e?ttag=BM10_EM_all_cspt_os_inlk_0001">here</a>.&nbsp;The password is: madness. You can fill out/change your bracket until CBS locks the brackets Thursday when the games start.</p>
<p>See you at the big dance! Bring your friends!</p>
