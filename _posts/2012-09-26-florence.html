<p>Art museums are always near the top of things I like to do when traveling. I've been enjoying sculpture more and more lately, and Florence is a fantastic place for sculpture. They even have an open pavilion with some original statues for the public to admire.&nbsp;The real statue of David is in Florence. I had no idea how big it was. It's towering.&nbsp;There's also a really pretty cathedral.</p>

<p><!--more-->I&nbsp;went to another musical concert, this time an opera. They performed "La Traviata", <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zmwRitYO3w">my favorite flash mob</a>, what the story of Moulin Rouge is based on, and also the opera in Pretty Woman. It was another intimate setting with only 4 singers in a tiny church.</p>

<p>The food was kind of like wine: expensive doesn't always mean good, and cheap doesn't always mean bad. I went to a highly rated restaurant. They had a special part of the menu that is supposedly the reason they are famous. It's a menu of pastas made with ingredients and techniques of the Renaissance or something like that. 26&euro; for a small plate of pasta and 3 large shrimp. That plus a mixed appetizer plate + 15% service + 3.50&euro; "cuperto" (a common way for European restaurants to charge more while doing nothing) came out to be $60+. It was good, but not that good. On the other hand, Some bruschetta and tortellini for much less and just as tasty if not more so.</p>
<p>I also had some really good homemade gelato. It tasted like a lemon chill.</p>
<p>I don't really like coffee, but I had to try a cappuccino (with lots of sugar).</p>
