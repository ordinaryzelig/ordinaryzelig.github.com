title: Scam or ridiculous sign from g-d? Let's find out.
category: blog

<p>For several months now, I&rsquo;ve been getting a call from an unidentified number in Louisianna. I&rsquo;ve ignored it until now. They called me 15 minutes ago, and I decided to find out who it was. It sure sounded like a salesman. But he had all this information on me that I filled out at the Paseo Arts District. You know, one of those &ldquo;sign up for a free cruise and $50,000&rdquo;. Apparently it worked. The dude told me I&rsquo;m one of 250 finalists for $50,000, and I&rsquo;ve already won an all expenses paid cruise to the bahamas. Score! Oh, and it gives me entries to the lottery too. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>All I have to do is go to one of their offices on Northwest Expressway and listen to them for about 30 minutes about their travel agency. Pretty sure I can handle that. Let&rsquo;s just hope this isn&rsquo;t some matchstick men scheme. But it sure sounds worth it.</p>
<p>All this, after I spent a long time surfing at <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/top40.">http://www.airbnb.com/top40.</a> And they&rsquo;re even hiring a Rails developer. Might be a sign. Or a scam. We&rsquo;ll find out.</p>
