<p>woke up early and was told that we were going to the great wall of china, just the three of us, me and my host parents. &nbsp;host dad says he&rsquo;s going with us but he&rsquo;s not going to climb the wall. &nbsp;i figured he just didn&rsquo;t want to do all the walking. &nbsp;so we drive for more than two hours just to get there. &nbsp;buy the tickets for me and my host mom and start up a hill. &nbsp;alright, it&rsquo;s just a little incline, not too bad. &nbsp;a few steps later, i start dying.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>stairs. &nbsp;hey, i&rsquo;m at the great of wall of china. &nbsp;i can make it up some steps. &nbsp; oh, more steps eh? &nbsp;alright. &nbsp;no problem, just a little further. &nbsp;more? &nbsp;i have to slow down so i can catch my breath and my thighs can recover from the strain. &nbsp;you can do it. &nbsp;start climbing again, thighs start hurting again. &nbsp; have to stop. &nbsp;kids start running past me. &nbsp;my host mom decides to show off and skip steps. &nbsp;i&rsquo;m hoping that at the top is heaven, cause i&rsquo;m about to die here. &nbsp;they should call it the great staircase. &nbsp;every once in a while there&rsquo;s a vendor selling film or water. &nbsp;after about the 10th one i pass, i start asking if they sell oxygen. &nbsp;i say, &ldquo;lady, do you see that? &nbsp;that&rsquo;s a cloud. &nbsp;i need oxygen right now.&rdquo; &nbsp;continue to kill myself slowly. &nbsp;at this point i&rsquo;m crawling. &nbsp;old dudes with both hands behind their back walk casually past me. &nbsp;the great wall was originally built to keep Huns from crossing into their territory. &nbsp;if i were a Hun, i&rsquo;d give up too.</p>
<p>finally make it to the top of the mountain (even the signs say mountain). so this is the great wall eh? &nbsp;i&rsquo;d been before, but at a different place that wasn&rsquo;t as pretty. &nbsp;hear a lamb. &nbsp;look around, nobody seemed to notice. &nbsp;hear it again. &nbsp;am i the only one that can hear this? &nbsp;it starts smelling like a zoo. &nbsp; look down and see two lambs. &nbsp;that was all there was at the top.</p>
<p>the way down was the best part. &nbsp;you can either walk down (or roll down in my case), take the cable car, or slide down. &nbsp;that&rsquo;s right, slide down. &nbsp;you sit on these scooter thingies (toboggins, they call them). &nbsp;push forward on the handle to go faster and pull back to apply brake. &nbsp;it&rsquo;s just a slide. &nbsp;it was fun. &nbsp;in front of me and my host mom were these four american girls. &nbsp;the third one was kinda scared so she went kinda slow and held some of us up. &nbsp;but i had chances to go fast. &nbsp;when we were going slow i started conversing with the girl in front of me. &nbsp;&rdquo;so, where you from?&rdquo; &nbsp;along the slide there are workers there to make sure you&rsquo;re ok and tell you to go faster or slower. &nbsp;i asked one of the guys that had a total of three teeth what he was doing for the summer. &nbsp;he didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>naturally, at the great wall of china, you&rsquo;re bound to see some foreigners. &nbsp;this was the first time i had seen people with non-black hair in a long time. &nbsp; some americans too. &nbsp;american kids. &nbsp;i didn&rsquo;t talk to them, but it was nice to see some american kids. &nbsp;miss you guys. &nbsp;see you soon.</p>
