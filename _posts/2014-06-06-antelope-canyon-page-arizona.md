Chances are, you've seen this place before.
It must be on the syllabus for abstract nature photographraphy 101.

The next day we went river rafting on the Colorado River on a motorized pontoon.

Our last stop on the pontoon before turning around was at Horseshoe Bend.
Just after the rafting trip, we went to see Horseshoe Bend from above, a very different angle, and just as beautiful.

If you continue on the river, it ends up at the Grand Canyon.
But we had one more stop before then, another highly recognizable area: [Monument Valley]({% post_url 2014-06-07-monument-valley %})
