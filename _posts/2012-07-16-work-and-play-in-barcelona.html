<p>Booked my Airbnb stay in Barcelona. 1 full week. A very long stay compared to the other places. I'm going to the <a href="http://baruco.org/">BaRuCo</a> conference, which I hope will be in English. Otherwise, I better learn how to say <em>meta programming</em> in Spanish.</p>
<p>Stephanie says this is her favorite place in Europe, so I'm giving it what I hope is enough time to experience it. The person I'm staying with says she likes food of all kinds. I'm very excited. Apparently this is the view.<img src="https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/2749391/large.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Not too bad for $229 for a full week.</p>
