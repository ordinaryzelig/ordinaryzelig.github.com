It took way too long. I procrastinated and all the good places got booked. It's also frustrating that I took so long to decide. And it bit me like it always does. I plan on staying at like 15 different places. I really don't want to go through this 15 times. From now on, I'm going to try to give myself a time limit. We'll start with 1 hour. After that, I have to make a decision and be happy with it.</span></p>
