<p>i wake up at about 1230am with a pain on my right side. &nbsp;i thought it was just a cramp or something but it got worse. &nbsp;it started hurting pretty bad so i got up and tried to walk it off. &nbsp;it wouldn&rsquo;t go away so i woke up Liang, my host mom and we go to the hospital. &nbsp;not a happy sight. &nbsp;i saw a doctor after waiting a while. &nbsp;she said to get a urine sample, so i did. &nbsp;they analyzed it and found some stuff that shouldn&rsquo;t be in there. &nbsp;apparently it&rsquo;s like kidney stones. &nbsp;when you get a whole bunch of it and they come together, they become kidney stones. &nbsp;i also had to give a blood sample. &nbsp;they just pricked my finger like they do when you donate blood. &nbsp;another doctor examined me and said i needed to drink lots of water and come back the next day. &nbsp;before i left, i had to get a shot in the backside. &nbsp;earlier that day i got my second hepatitis b shot. &nbsp;so if you add that with the finger prick, this would make three shots in one day.</p>
<p>i went home and went back to sleep. &nbsp;woke up early the next morning and went back the next morning to do an ultrasound. &nbsp;they said that i had to drink a lot of water to expand my bladder and stuff to see clearly. &nbsp;i drank 1.25&nbsp;L of sprite. &nbsp;they didn&rsquo;t find anything. &nbsp;after waking up i felt better anyway. but i did have a headache from not sleeping well. &nbsp;hopefully after a goodnight&rsquo;s sleep i&rsquo;ll feel all better tomorrow.</p>
