<p>The <a href="http://getlost.posterous.com/orlando-2011">next day</a> we went to Disney's Animal Kingdom. The best part was getting to go on a mini safari with Cecelia. She had seen a lot of my safari stuff from Africa and she loves animals, so it was an exciting little ride. We saw hippos, giraffes (her favorite), elephants (my favorite), and even a rhino. We also watched a Finding Nemo play that went through the whole movie in about 20 minutes. My favorite part was Nigel, the pelican. His giant head takes up a third of the stage and it pokes in from time to time.</p>
