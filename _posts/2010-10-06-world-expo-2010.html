<p>This was the line to just get into the grounds. There was airport-like security. Believe it or not, this line only took less than an hour. The lines at the popular pavilions were not so short. The longest one was at Saudi Arabia's pavilion. When I got in line, I asked how long the wait was from where I was standing. 8+ hours. As I was leaving the line, there were still lots of people packing in behind me.</p>
