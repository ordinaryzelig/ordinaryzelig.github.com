Zion National Park is very different from Bryce.
There are no Hoodoos.
Instead, you descend into a beautiful abyss.
I thought the drive in/out was even more beautiful than the inside of the park itself.
But nothing compares to our hike.
Easily one of the most unique hikes I've ever done.
It's called "The Narrows", and it's easy to see why.
But what really makes it unique is the terrain: part of it is under water.
