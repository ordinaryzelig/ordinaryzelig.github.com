<p>so i wanted to go to the art museum. &nbsp;asked hostmom how to get there. &nbsp;&rdquo;it&rsquo;s real easy,&rdquo; she says. &nbsp;&rdquo;you can take the bus. &nbsp;there&rsquo;s a bus stop right in front of the museum and you don&rsquo;t even have to change buses.&rdquo; &nbsp;nice. &nbsp;she gives me directions. &nbsp;next day, i get up all ready to go.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>

<p>there&rsquo;s several different kinds of buses in beijing. &nbsp;the nicest ones look like the buses you would imagine in africa. &nbsp;dirty, beat up, emit large amounts of smoke, make weird noises, no a/c, wobbly, squeaky, etc. &nbsp;every time the driver stops, the engine dies. &nbsp;no, seriously, they have to restart the engine before they can move again. &nbsp;they have all different kinds of lines and you have to find the right number to get to where you want. &nbsp;when you get on, they don&rsquo;t have the little thingy where you drop in your coins. &nbsp;they have a special person that goes around and collects cash and gives you a paper ticket. &nbsp;actually, you just give her cash when you feel like it. &nbsp;once in a while she&rsquo;ll go around the bus to check to see if everybody has a ticket. &nbsp;and when you get off, you&rsquo;re supposed to show her your ticket. &nbsp;i&rsquo;m sure you can imagine how easy it would be to get a free ride.</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m supposed to take the 103. &nbsp;half an hour&rsquo;s ride if there isn&rsquo;t any traffic. &nbsp;hostmom told me to ask the ticket lady to tell me when to get off. &nbsp;i figure i&rsquo;d just ask her after about 20 minutes. &nbsp;well, 15 minutes later, we stop at a very dirty place and a surprisingly large amount of people get off. &nbsp;no, make that everybody is getting off. &nbsp;i look around. &nbsp;umm, i don&rsquo;t see an art museum. &nbsp;but ok. &nbsp;get off and the bus starts to drive away. &nbsp;but then i see it stop a few feet from where it kicked all of us off. &nbsp;people are starting to get on. &nbsp;was this a ploy to get me off the bus? &nbsp;did i do something wrong? &nbsp;i hear somebody say something about a u-turn. &nbsp;i think i went the wrong way (surprise surprise). &nbsp;i think i&rsquo;m at the end of the line. &nbsp;hmm, if i get on, i&rsquo;ll look like an idiot to the ticket lady. &nbsp;&rdquo;heh heh heh, funny lookin american is lost, heh heh heh.&rdquo; &nbsp;i think i&rsquo;ll wait for the next one thank you.</p>
<p>103. &nbsp;that&rsquo;s me. &nbsp;not many people on this bus. &nbsp;i ask the ticket lady if it goes to the art museum but she doesn&rsquo;t answer me. &nbsp;she&rsquo;s talking to these three ladies sitting outside. &nbsp;i ask her again and again, and she doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge me. &nbsp;finally she looks up at me with a weird face. &nbsp;she says something i can&rsquo;t understand and her and the three ladies outside start laughing. &nbsp;mkay, i think i&rsquo;ll just sit down now. &nbsp;maybe i should just get off and get a taxi. &nbsp;nah, he&rsquo;ll probably take me to the great wall and charge me a billion rmb (about $10 us). &nbsp;bus only costs a buck. &nbsp;i ask the ticket lady again if she could warn me when we get close to the art museum. &nbsp;she ignores me again with a smile on her face. &nbsp;and then she helps this old lady with a kid find a seat. &nbsp;thanks lady, what service. &nbsp;we get to an intersection and the bus stops because a stupid car has eeked it&rsquo;s way through the intersection and the bus can&rsquo;t turn without hitting it. &nbsp;mean ticket lady runs over to my window and practically lays on me to look out the window. &nbsp;excuse me, lost american sitting down here, can i have some air now? &nbsp;i think she did it on purpose.</p>
<p>let&rsquo;s see, since it took me 15 minutes to get lost (that&rsquo;s actually pretty good for me), and it takes 30 minutes to get to the art museum going the right way, then i&rsquo;ll ride the bus this way for 45 minutes and i should be there in no time&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;hour and a half later, i hear the recording say something that resembled the art museum. &nbsp;i get up and walk towards the door. &nbsp;it opens and i look around but see no art museum. &nbsp;well, it&rsquo;s probably around here somewhere, i&rsquo;ll just get &mdash; ok nevermind. &nbsp;door closes and bus starts moving again. &nbsp;get off at the next stop on impulse. &nbsp;i&rsquo;m so lost. &nbsp;i ask around if anybody knows where the art museum is. &nbsp;keep on cruisin. &nbsp;wangfu hotel. &nbsp;hey, this is where i stayed 10 years ago. &nbsp;now i can just call my dad and ask him to pick me up. &nbsp;keep on cruisin. &nbsp;art museum! &nbsp;woohoo! &nbsp;let&rsquo;s see, entrance, entrance, entrance. &nbsp;hey, there&rsquo;s an opening over there. &nbsp;heart starts pumpin, i&rsquo;m gettin excited. &nbsp;turn the corner. &nbsp;hard hats. &nbsp;hard hats everywhere. &nbsp;why is everyone wearing hard hats? &nbsp;and why is there scaffolding around the building? &nbsp;is this supposed to be artistic? &nbsp;son of a&hellip;!</p>
<p>heart in my shoes, i walk back to the bus stop that i missed the first time. &nbsp;bunches of people. &nbsp;i&rsquo;m going to get robbed on the bus. &nbsp;but i don&rsquo;t care, i&rsquo;m going home. &nbsp;&rdquo;everybody scoot in!&rdquo; ticket lady shouts. &nbsp;nobody moves, of course. &nbsp;people, i&rsquo;m going home on this bus whether you like it or not. &nbsp;nobody moves. &nbsp;fine, i&rsquo;ll just stand on the steps. &nbsp;grab a hold of a rail. &nbsp;whoosh!</p>
<p>son of a&hellip;! &nbsp;door slams shut taking my arm along with it. &nbsp;the rail that i grabbed was part of the door. &nbsp;i almost stumbled down, if it&rsquo;s possible to stumble down two steps. &nbsp;&rdquo;door closing!&rdquo; &nbsp;oh, gee, thanks for the warning, ticket lady. &nbsp;here&rsquo;s your stupid dollar. &nbsp;you know what, have two dollars, take your kids to the art museum.</p>
<p>so i&rsquo;m standing in the well of the bus holding on to dear life since nobody will move. &nbsp;i bet if the door flings open, i&rsquo;ll get squashed like a cartoon.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s it. &nbsp;i squeeze my way through some sweaty people and find a spot. &nbsp;bus stops and about another thousand people get on. &nbsp;ok, can&rsquo;t breathe. &nbsp;hey now, i don&rsquo;t know you, get off me please. &nbsp;and, dude, i hope you&rsquo;re enjoying my armpit. &nbsp;probably the first time you&rsquo;ve smelled deodorant huh?</p>
<p>finally get to my stop, first time i got it right all day. &nbsp;my arms feel like they&rsquo;re down at my ankles from holding on so tight to the rail. &nbsp;get home and tell hostmom my story. &nbsp;so that&rsquo;s my art museum episode even though there really was no art museum. &nbsp;at least i only spent two bucks. &nbsp;well, three hours and 2 bucks. &nbsp;the end. &nbsp;miss you guys!</p>
