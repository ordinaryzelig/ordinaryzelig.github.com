I used to go to Germany once or twice a year for work.
The last time I went was summer 2019 - the trip where I proposed to Stephanie in Croatia.
Then Covid hit, we got married, and Eliza came along.
So there were no Germany trips for us for a long time.
I missed a lot of company events.
Earlier this year I made it a goal to make it back to Germany in the summer.

Elizaâ€™s longest plane ride prior to this trip was 3.5h to New York.
Her biggest time zone change was 2 hours to California.
Germany is 7 hours ahead of us.
We decided to break up the trip by going back to New York again, and then fly nonstop to Munich - an 8 hour flight.

This trip to NYC included The Statue of Liberty, Summit at 1 Vanderbilt, lots of subway rides, The High Line, a visit with Allaire, a dear friend from middle school, and the first of many rendezvous with cousin Mandi.
