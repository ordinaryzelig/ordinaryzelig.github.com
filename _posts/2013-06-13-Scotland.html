<p>Week 3 of our trip was dedicated to Scotland. The majority of our time in Edinburgh was spent walking all over city center. My favorite was climbing the hills of Holyrood Park up to the peak called Arthur's Seat. The Holyrood hills are in the middle of the city, whicih makes it the best view of the city.</p>

<p>Due to our late planning and short amount of time, and against our usual travel practices, we decided to take a bus tour of the Highlands. Each stop was prettier than the last. And in between we got earfulls of Scotish history -- mainly future history when Scotland tries to cut its ties from Great Britain next year and become independent. Our bus driver/guide was also not a fan of Margaret Thatcher. He talked about her the way US vets talk about Jane Fonda. He was definitely not Fonda Thatcher. Moving on.</p>

<p>Yes, we went to Loch Ness. No we didn't see the monster. We didn't even go on the water. It was too expensive and just not our thing. We opted for the nice (free) walk up a hill that goes along the loch.</p>

<p>Even after some whiskey, no monster.</p>
