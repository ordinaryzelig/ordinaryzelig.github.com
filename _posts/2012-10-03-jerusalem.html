<p>We booked our tour for a day that happened to be during an important Jewish holiday called Sukkot. There were tons of Hasidic Jews (the ones that wear black and the men wear black hats and have curly hair hanging down the side of their heads) going to the old city. We saw the resurrection site of Jesus and his tomb. We also went to the wailing wall, but there were too many people and too little time for me to want to fight the crowds to touch it.</p>
<p>The most interesting part for me was the dense population of different religions living in a very small area. The guide told us that they all had their own little sections of Jerusalem with no fences or walls separating them, yet there was very little interaction between them.</p>
<p>I don't have many pictures to show. It's not exactly a photogenic place. It's definitely more of a spiritual place.</p>
