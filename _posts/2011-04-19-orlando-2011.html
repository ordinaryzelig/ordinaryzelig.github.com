<p>My sister had to be in Orlando and Tampa on business. Since I have very flexible hours, she had the wonderful idea of inviting me to meet her and my niece Cecelia there. As luck would have it, Stephanie had use-it-or-lose-it leave. So the 4 of us decided to make a fun vacation out of my sister's business trip.</p>
