It's hard to capture the Grand Canyon with a camera.
The experience is even more difficult.

I would've liked to have hiked to the bottom, but there just wasn't enough time.
Stephanie and I did hike part of the way down Bright Angel Trail, and it was pretty difficult.
It was fairly hot, and it gets hotter the further down you go.
We passed a couple that had hiked from the other side of the canyon.
It took them 4 days, and this was even one of the shortest ways across to the other side.

The view from as far down as we got:

The highlight for me was the mule ride along the rim.
My mule's name was Junkie.
I could tell he was a bit stubborn, but we got along great.
As the ride went on, he turned with much less effort on my part.
And I figured out that he responded more to kicking than the whip.
By the way, if you ever want to see an amazing documentary about how horses mirror the rider, watch [Buck](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1753549/).
