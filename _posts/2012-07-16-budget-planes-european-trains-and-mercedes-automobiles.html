<p>I booked my flight from Barcelona to Stuttgart where My dad is going to pick up his new Mercedes straight from the factory (the car comes with a tour of the factory too). Taking a train simply isn't practical. I have 2 days to get from Barcelona to Stuttgart. The train would've taken maybe a full day's worth of travel. So I'd be spending a lot of time on the train when I could be seeing more of Barcelona. With a 2 hour flight, I have 1 more full day and maybe a morning of Barcelona. And it only cost $100.59. It could've been ~$50, but I waited too long and those flights got booked.</p>
