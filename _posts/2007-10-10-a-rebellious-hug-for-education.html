title: a rebellious hug for education
categories: blog
---
<p>i recently learned that a new trend is starting in schools: banning hugs. the principal who seems to be the most credited for this is dr. victoria sharts, which is appropriate, because this is a fucking piece of shit.</p>
<p>her rationale: people (esp. girls) that hug each other clog hallways. another principal had an even better excuse: &ldquo;would you want your children to be hugging or kissing at school without your knowledge?&rdquo; at least he was more straightforward about it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21097673/">here&rsquo;s one article</a>.</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s not just hugs. high fives? all physical contact? those are just casualties, distractions, and justifications for banning hugs. what is it REALLY they&rsquo;re trying to accomplish? whatever it is, it ain&rsquo;t keeping prom dresses on. if anything, it&rsquo;s going to make them rip off as soon as the principal is out of sight.</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have a solution. but don&rsquo;t insult people&rsquo;s intelligence feeding them shit about clogging hallways and scaring parents into thinking that there&rsquo;s hugging going on at school without their knowledge like it&rsquo;s drugs.</p>
<p>why do these people think that simply imposing rules is a replacement for real education? it&rsquo;s a common behavior: when you take something away from a someone and they don&rsquo;t buy into the reason, they rebel, esp. kids in middle school and high school. you&rsquo;re not doing a good job of teaching. and don&rsquo;t give me that &ldquo;when you get older, you&rsquo;ll understand&rdquo; crap. all that is is a failure to communicate. there are no shortcuts in education. either you educate or you don&rsquo;t. and enforcing an unsupported attempt at education can and often does have adverse effects. you know who follows unsupported rules without questioning them? mindless drones. robots. fascists. yes, they&rsquo;re kids, but don&rsquo;t pretend they have the comprehension skills of babies. relate to them. people respond better when you are able to convince them that you genuinely care and can empathize.</p>
