<p>Bruges is officially the place I'm most excited to visit so far on my trip. Just look at this place, it's so <a href="http://images.google.com/search?q=bruges&amp;biw=1531&amp;bih=1088&amp;sei=IKUWUIK_EcWtqQHivoD4BA&amp;tbm=isch">gorgeous and charming</a>. And look at <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/475774">the place I'm staying</a>. <img src="https://a3.muscache.com/pictures/5621937/large.jpg" alt="" /> How charming is that? The owner prides herself on&nbsp;breakfast.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotos-g188671-d642757-Hobo_Bed_and_Breakfast-Bruges_West_Flanders_Province.html"><img src="http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/58/3c/57/breakfast-at-hobo.jpg" alt="Photos of Hobo Bed and Breakfast, Bruges" /></a></p>
<p>Admitedly, the only reason I wanted to visit was because of the movie&nbsp;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/">In Bruges</a>. But then I also remembered that it's where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil#Background">Dr. Evil was raised to be evil</a>. Can't wait.</p>
<p>$170 2 nights. Well over my $40/night budget, but seems like a worthy splurge.</p>
