<p>I got a really good client that I've been working with for the past couple of months. The last 2 weeks were especially busy. As of now, based on some really rough estimation, I think I have enough to officially go beyond the point of no return. So, I just&nbsp;bought my <a href="http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/global-pass">Eurail Global pass</a> today. At&nbsp;$2,000,&nbsp;It's&nbsp;by far&nbsp;the biggest 1-time expense of the trip. I bought the plane ticket with 60K miles + $100. <em>(I'd really like to keep good records on expenses, but I don't know of a good way to keep track of this stuff and share it in an efficient way yet.)</em></p>
