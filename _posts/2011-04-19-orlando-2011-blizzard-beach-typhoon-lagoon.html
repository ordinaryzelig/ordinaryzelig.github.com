<p><a href="http://getlost.posterous.com/orlando-2011">Next day</a> was Blizzard Beach, one of 2 Disney water parks.</p>
<p><!--more-->This was Cecelia's favorite, not surprisingly with her love of water. There's a wave pool, a river that goes around the park, kiddie slides, not so kiddie slides, and a crazy why-not-just-go-cliff-diving slide. There's also a ski lift, something you don't normally find at a water park in Orlando. Cecelia loved the slides. She went 3 times which would've been more if the park hadn't closed. It was, in her words, "INCRE-IBLE". Later in the week we also went to Typhoon Lagoon, the other Disney water park. Not as good as Blizzard Beach, but still fun</p>
