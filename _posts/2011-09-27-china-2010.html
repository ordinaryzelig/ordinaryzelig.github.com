<p>In September 2010, My dad had a special birthday celebration in China. We started in Beijing at a famous hotel called Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. We had a fancy dinner banquet here as well. Later we went to Shanghai to see the World Expo.<p />  Music credits:<br /> Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon<br /> The Last Emperor<br /> The Karate Kid, Part II<br /> Hackers</p>
