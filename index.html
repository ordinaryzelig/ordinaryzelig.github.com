        <h2>Quality Work</h2>
        <p>I will tackle any Ruby tasks that you need. I can write anything from small Ruby scripts to full-blown Web applications.</p>
        <p>I'm very friendly, easy to talk to, and easy to work with. Whether you are technical or not, I talk in plain English with no jargon so that you know exactly what's going on and how things work. I don't just work FOR you, but WITH you.</p>
        <p>My code is clean, readable, and regularly refactored. <strong>TESTING IS A HIGH PRIORITY IN MY WORK, NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT.</strong>
        <p><strong>I WILL WORK FOR A LOWER RATE FOR GOOD CAUSES.</strong></p>

        <h2>Efficient and Easy for You</h2>
        <p>For web applications, I use <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, a service that allows me to quickly give you a product in a working state so you can immediately interact with it. No work needed on your end. I just give you a web address, and you see results in seconds.</p>

        <h2>Knowledgeable</h2>
        <p>I regularly follow Ruby news and attend conferences, so you can be confident that I am keeping up with technology.</p>

        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>I can work any day of the week at any reasonable hour of the day. I've had clients across the globe and have had no problems making myself available at a time that is convenient for them. I respond to emails quickly and give plenty of warning if I will not be available.</p>

        <h2>Why Testing Matters</h2>
        <p><strong>There is no such thing as bug-free code.</strong> If you were an online bank, how confident are you that every transaction is working like it is designed to? Can you afford to have a bug? With automated tests, you have code that verifies your application is working as expected. Most good programmers nowadays are thoroughly testing their code. It helps with development, and it helps when things go wrong like many things eventually do. Tests will also help you make sure that fixing a bug here won't cause another bug way over there. <strong>Not having automated tests makes development SEVERAL TIMES slower, costing more money and more headache.</strong></p>
